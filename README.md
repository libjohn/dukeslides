![lifecycle:
deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-deprecated-orange "Lifecycle: deprecated")
There will be no further development of `library(dukeslides)`. This
package has been deprecated in favor of using the following teachniques
and packages:

-   [Quarto revealJS presentations](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/).

## Try this INSTEAD. An Example ![LifeCycle: Superseded by](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-superseded%20by-brightgreen "LifeCycle: Superseded by")

Again, **`dukeslides` has been deprecated** and **ALSO superseded by**
newer techniques. An [example slide
deck](https://people.duke.edu/~jrl/dashboard_wednesday/#1) using the
above helper packages shows an end result. AND here is the [R Markdown
code used to generated the
example](https://github.com/libjohn/presentation_dashboards_firstWed)
