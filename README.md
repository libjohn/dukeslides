# dukeslides

![lifecycle:
deprecated](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-deprecated-orange "Lifecycle: deprecated")
There will be no further development of `library(dukeslides)`. This
package has been deprecated in favor of using the following teachniques
and packages:

-   [`library(xaringan)`](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)
-   [`library(xaringanthemer)`](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanthemer)
-   [`library(xaringanExtra)`](https://github.com/gadenbuie/xaringanExtra)
    & Tachyons
-   [story Remark Themes](https://story.xaprb.com/slides/adirondack/#2)

## Try this INSTEAD. An Example ![LifeCycle: Superseded by](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-superseded%20by-brightgreen "LifeCycle: Superseded by")

Again, **`dukeslides` has been deprecated** and **ALSO superseded by**
newer techniques. An [example slide
deck](https://people.duke.edu/~jrl/dashboard_wednesday/#1) using the
above helper packages shows an end result. AND here is the [R Markdown
code used to generated the
example](https://github.com/libjohn/presentation_dashboards_firstWed)
